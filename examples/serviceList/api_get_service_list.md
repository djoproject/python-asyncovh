How to get list of services with Python wrapper?
------------------------------------------------

This documentation will help you to list your services at ovh.

## Requirements

- Having an OVH Account with services inside

## Install Python wrapper

The easiest way to get the latest stable release is to grab it from pypi using ```pip```.

```bash
python3.7 -m pip install tabulate git+https://github.com/djoproject/python-asyncovh.git#egg=asyncovh
```

## Create a new token

You can create a new token using this url: [https://api.ovh.com/createToken/?GET=/*](https://api.ovh.com/createToken/?GET=/*).
Keep application key, application secret and consumer key and replace default values in ```ovh.conf``` file.

```ini
[default]
; general configuration: default endpoint
endpoint=ovh-eu

[ovh-eu]
; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
application_key=my_app_key
application_secret=my_application_secret
; uncomment following line when writing a script application
; with a single consumer key.
consumer_key=my_consumer_key
```

Be warned, this token is only valid to get information of your OVH services. You cannot changes or delete your products with it.
If you need a more generic token, you may adjust the **Rights** fields at your needs.

## Download the script
